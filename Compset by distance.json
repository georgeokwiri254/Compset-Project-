Grand Millennium Dubai competitive set analysis
Last message 12 minutes ago
Instructions
--- 🏨 Revenue Manager Prompt: Competitor Set Analysis for Strategic Positioning. I will upload a compset analysis toolkit, search the web for hotel features and rank at least 10 hotels which should be in my compset. Fill in the excel sheet do the calculations search for the data online and output as an excel sheet file. Objective: Evaluate and recommend the most accurate competitor set for [Grand Millennium], ensuring alignment with our property’s market positioning, room mix, meeting capacity, guest profile, and online reputation. The goal is to identify hotels that directly compete with us in pricing, product, and perception, enabling accurate benchmarking of ADR, RevPAR, and rate strategy. --- 1. Market Positioning & Brand Fit Identify hotels within a 5–7 km radius competing in the same luxury/upscale business segment. Compare brand strength, star rating, and location advantages. Evaluate accessibility to business hubs, attractions, and key demand generators. --- 2. Room Inventory & Mix Analysis Compare the number and range of room types (standard, deluxe, club, suites, apartments). Assess average room sizes, in-room features, and furnishing quality. Analyze price positioning and ADR benchmarks for each comparable room category. Evaluate room type segmentation — corporate, long-stay, leisure, and family suitability. --- 3. Meetings & Events Capability Identify hotels with comparable meeting and event space (sqm, number of rooms, capacity). Note banquet flexibility, ballroom capacity, and technology/AV offerings. Review MICE reviews and ratings from corporate clients and planners. Evaluate potential overlap in target accounts or event segments. --- 4. Online Reputation & Review Sentiment Extract guest reviews from platforms like TripAdvisor, Booking.com, and Google. Perform sentiment analysis on service, cleanliness, breakfast, and staff experience. Rank competitors by average rating and review volume to assess brand perception. Identify key differentiators driving guest satisfaction and repeat business. --- 5. Features & Amenities Evaluation Benchmark facilities such as pool, spa, gym, restaurants, and executive lounges. Review unique amenities (private cinema, serviced apartments, rooftop bar, etc.) that enhance guest value and ADR potential. Include sustainability programs or digital technology features that appeal to modern travelers. --- 6. Pricing & Distribution Review Track rate parity and OTA positioning over the last 30–60 days. Evaluate BAR strategy, corporate rates, and long-stay pricing. Compare package inclusions (breakfast, lounge access, airport transfers). Assess dynamic rate adjustments versus market movement using historical data. --- 7. Segmentation & Demand Mix Identify business segments driving demand for each property (corporate, MICE, leisure, OTA, direct). Determine which competitors attract similar accounts or market sources. Highlight opportunities for displacement, rate growth, or share gain. --- 8. Data Output Requirements Deliver a comparison matrix summarizing: Room types & counts Event spaces (sqm, capacity) Review score averages Key features & differentiators ADR and rate range Rank the Top 5–7 Competitors with a justification summary. Include recommendations for primary (core) and secondary (stretch) compsets. --- 9. Strategic Outcome The analysis should enable the Revenue Team to: Validate the current compset relevance. Identify any new emerging competitors or non-traditional threats. Support rate positioning, forecast accuracy, and market share strategy. Provide inputs for monthly rate strategy meetings and business reviews. --- Example Command for an AI or Analyst: > “Act as a Revenue Manager for Grand Millennium Dubai. Based on location, room mix, meeting capacity, and online reviews, identify the most comparable hotels in Barsha Heights and Sheikh Zayed Road. Create a ranked compset list with key metrics, review sentiment, and pricing strategy insights.” --- Would you like me to extend this prompt into a data-collection version — where an AI automatically scrapes and compares competitor data (reviews, features, ADRs, event spaces, etc.) for you?
